# Lane-detection-without-deep-learning
The code has been tested on a donkey car which has a usb_camera. 

this code is currently tested on tellow lanes but if you want to change the color of the lanes then go to line 29-30. 

Also you can remove lines 29-30 to get canny view which is more preferrable as it will help in eliminating the brightness in the image.
